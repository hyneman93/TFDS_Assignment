I am interested in data science because in my field you can develop the right measures to tackle problem by means of correct use and interpretation of data

The following code calculates the sum of two integers numbers
x = int(input("Please insert the first integer number of the sum > "))
print(x)
y = int(input("Please insert the second integer number of the sum > "))
print(y)

sum = x + y

print("The total is " + str(sum))
5
10
The total is 15
Here the result in tabular form:
x	y	sum
5	10	15
Try yourself!
Click on the Run button to run the code
Insert the first integer and press enter
Insert the second integer and press enter
Get the total of the sum wanted printed out
